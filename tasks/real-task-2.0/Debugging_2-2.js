Error: CONNECTION ERROR: Could't connect to node http://127.0.0.1:8545 at Object.InvalidConnection

/** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pick the correct choices:

 - Check whether the port is blocked
 - Check whether client I am trying to connect to is running
 - Find source of the calling software and look at how it connects to node
 - Re-install both pieces of software
